## ‚ú® Key Features

- Self custody without seed phrases (not good user experience)
- Social recovery with guardians (people, secondary wallet)
- Seamless integration with Yubikey as a physical wallet
- Setting transaction limit to prevent wallets being emptied
- Ability to interact with arbitrary smart contracts
- Customized avatar based on public key, generated fully on-chain

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting started

There are no formal blockchain or Web 3 prerequisites for this tutorial, but you should have some experience with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). Having said that, you can certainly complete the tutorial if you at least know basic [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). You might just find it more difficult to follow the app's pre-built functionality.

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed. Then clone the repo and run both the `yarn` and `npm install` command to install the app dependencies. Currently krypton supports node v16 so you need to run `nvm use 16`.

```
git clone https://github.com/krypton-wallet/chrome-extension.git
cd frontend
yarn && npm install && nvm use 16
```

## üíª Build extension

Build the krypton extension with

```
nvm use 16
cd frontend
yarn build
```

You can load unpacked the /frontend/out folder in chrome extension developer mode and use it

## High-level Overview

- Chrome extension interacts with Krypton wallet smart contract for all core functionality
- Uses Chrome local storage to cache current account results for better UX
- Interacts with the avatar smart contract for custom avatar generation and bloss library for Yubikey integration

### Startup

- On startup, create a new wallet on `devnet`
  - If testing on `mainnet-beta` is required, then just switch networks, fund the wallet, and continue using as normal
  - **NOTE**: you can skip the `devnet` creation step while testing by hardcoding a `mainnet-beta` prefunded keypair to initialize the account
- If creating a Yubikey account, ensure that a keypair is setup, `bloss-native` is installed, and the Yubikey is plugged in
- Guardian threshold is an important parameter that determines the number of guardian signatures required before you can recover your account (**NOTE**: Currently, it is implemented so that it cannot be updated anywhere else. However, the Krypton smart contract allows for it to be updated after startup as well)
- To initialize the account with a customized avatar that is generated fully on-chain, just check the corresponding box (**NOTE**: This is currently only available on `devnet`)
